# Math Problems

My solutions to either class-assigned problems, problems I've found in books, or just problem sets that I thought were interesting. For problem sets under "Class Problems," the following table notes what book was used for each class.

| Class              | Book Title                          | Author          |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Abstract Algebra I | Abstract Algebra                    | Dummit \& Foote |
| Real Analysis I    | Real Analysis for Graduate Students | Richard F. Bass |
